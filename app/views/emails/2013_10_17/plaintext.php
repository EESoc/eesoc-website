### BP Event
######################

Join us today in 509 at 1 PM, where a Subway lunch will be provided, and all attendees are put in to an iPad Mini raffle!

This will be a great opportunity to hear from graduate engineers about their roles within BP across instrumentation, control, measurement, telecommunications and other aspects of EEE. BP will be giving an overview of their key projects for the year and how you can get involved in summer internships & graduate opportunities. The event will end with hints & tips on the application process.

######################
### Soc Off
######################

Join us for the annual Soc Off competition! Held at Metric, the Soc Off is a friendly night of competition between every society. Each department battles through heated games of twister, sumo suit competitions and more! There is a £1 entry fee with all the door money awarded to the DepSocs with the highest turnouts!

Bring your parents, children, siblings and friends, and help EESoc win. If we are amongst the winning societies, we will be giving out a prize to the best picture posted to our instagram(#EESoc), Twitter (@eesoc) or Facbeook!

### Sport
A message from Chris
######################:

If you haven't heard from me before, I am this year's EEsoc Sports Officer. For our first event of the year we have teamed up with CivSoc for a 5-a-side football tournament!

It is on the 24th of October from 7pm outside the
Venue of Legends, Wembley Stadium. Teams of at least 5, and it's advisable to have a couple of subs. Interested in coming? Please email civsoc@ic.ac.uk directly with the names of all team members (and subs). Unfortunately we can only have a limited number of teams so signing up will be on a first come first served. The registration this year is £3 per person.

The places will go quickly so sign up ASAP!

Our CivSoc friends have been slating EEE's sporting ability; let's prove
them wrong!

When : 24th October, at 7pm.
Where: Royal Route, London. HA9 0WS. [Half an hour tube journey from SK,
two changes at Wembley Park]



Look forward to seeing you today,
Thomas Lim and the EESoc team
