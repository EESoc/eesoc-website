    <h2>Locker Issues Reporting</h2>
    <p>
      Dear {{{ $user->name }}},
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for purchasing a locker from EESoc.</p>
    <p>We have recently experienced a large amount of requests regarding removing the former owner's locks from the lockers.</p>
    <p>If this is an issue affecting you, <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/F4lJhQWHvn">please fill in your name and locker details here</a>. We will try to get the estate manager to remove the locks as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>For more complex issues, please fill in the Additional Information field when giving your details in the form above.</p>
    <p>
      We would also like to take this chance to remind you to be aware that the lockers are not 100% secure and so should only be used for items of low value. The safety of the contents of lockers is your responsibility. Neither EESoc nor the Department accept any liability for any items lost or stolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please be aware that combination padlocks are very insecure; a high percentage of thefts have been in lockers with these types of padlocks. All padlocks will only deter an opportunist thief; a committed thief will always break in.
    </p>
    <p>We apologises for any inconvenience this may be causing you.</p>
    <p>
      Kind Regards, <br/ >
      Poon on behalf of<br/>
      The EESoc Locker Team
