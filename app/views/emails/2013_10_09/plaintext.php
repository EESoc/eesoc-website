as any occupied locker will be opened and emptied after this date.
Send us an email if you cannot empty your locker by then. Under
certain circumstances, we will also let you keep your locker from
last year; please let us know ( mailto:eesoc@imperial.ac.uk ).

Technology in Investment Banking Series with Deutsche Bank
----------------------------------------------------------

Where would modern investment banking be without the cutting edge
technology that drives it? It's our GTO teams that have delivered
some of the solutions that have had the biggest impact on our
success. Within GTO, it's our analysis functions that help us
translate our business's needs into technical specifications and
then into the ground-breaking innovations that drive our business
forward.

At the event you'll learn how technology is shaping the financial
services industry and will get the chance to chat with Deutsche
Bank employees at a wide range of levels. They will be happy to
answer your questions and give you the insider's view of what a
career in our technology division is really like. Event details
are below.

Date: Thursday, 10th October 2013
Time: 6:30 - 8:30pm
Venue: Imperial Campus, Physics LT2, Campus
Registration: Please register your interest in attending the
event by emailing imperial.events@db.com (
mailto:imperial.events@db.com?subject=GTO%20Series%20Oct%2010%20RSVP
) with email Subject: GTO Series Oct 10 RSVP
Questions? Email Giri ( mailto:gsk10@ic.ac.uk ), one of our
Industrial Liaison Officers and former DB Placement Student.

Please note this is the first of a 3-part series looking into
Investment Banking technology. Students attending the session on
Thursday will be invited to Part 2 which is going to be held at
the Deutsche Bank offices in The City focusing on FX Trading.

I hope you are as excited as the rest of the team and I are about
the term we have coming up! We will be in touch soon so keep a
look out for more EESoc emails!

With Best Wishes,

Thomas Lim
