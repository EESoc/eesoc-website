Interested in a career with BP? Following our industrEE talk with BP on the 17th of October, a few tips for those interested applying to BP.

If you're getting ready to send an application or preparing an interview, make sure you read their website for <a href="http://bit.ly/1fZjzSz">tips and tricks</a>. BP also recommends to gain some background info from the <a href="http://bit.ly/16xhWZk">ISA</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1ihFCAM">INSTMC</a> and the <a href="http://bit.ly/1c2uvdf">IET</a>.

Finally, for those of you who joined us for BPs industrEE talk, take a look at <a href="http://bit.ly/1ihFVLS">this video</a> for an example of where a control system can go wrong. What happened here?

Incorrect measurement data caused the planes control system and pilot to take incorrect actions. I.e. tried to take off at to low air speed. System said they're traveling at 158 knots , they're  actually only doing 124 knots. Accurate Process Measurement is critical for all control and safety systems. Investigation revealed there was a solution available to compensate for the incorrect process measurement, but it had not been shared throughout the organisation.
