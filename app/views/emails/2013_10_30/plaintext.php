Presenters: Anton Lokhmotov (Staff Software Engineer) & James Greenhalgh (Graduate Engineer) will be giving an overview of ARM, the world's leading semi-conductor intellectual property supplier, from technological, business and personal perspectives. Both Anton and James are previous Imperial Graduates.

If you have just used a mobile phone, camera or MP3 player, chances are you have just used an ARM Powered Â® product. Our technology is at the heart of a wide range of digital products for use at home, work or on the move. ARM prides itself on being one of the best employers in the country, seeking to build on this by attracting the best university talent.

This 1 hour lecture covers the company business model and industry, basics of the ARM architecture, including the programmer's model, basic instruction sets, pipelines for the core families, AMBA, and development tools. Aimed at third or fourth-year students and faculty members, this presentation is designed to answer students' and faculty members' questions at the most technical level.

After the presentation, students will then have the opportunity to network with Current ARM Employees. Students may use this opportunity to ask any technical questions, learn more about how to start a career with ARM or pick up some application hints and tips from our Experienced Engineers at this event.

Make you sure you sign up to this event to be entered into a Prize draw. The winner will walk away with the giveaway after the Presentation! This year's prizes include; Samsung Tablet 3 7 inch, Samsung Tablet 3 8 inch, Samsung Chromebook.
