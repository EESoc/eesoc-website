EESoc, the Society for all students of the Department of Electrical & Electronic Egineering at Imperial College London

Good Morning EE-ers!

We hope your weekend has been relaxing, and that you're ready for Week 4! Thanks to everyone who came to the Soc Off. I'm sure you'll agree it was a fun evening– including the bit where I had to sumo wrestle RSM (there's a video below)! Our first IndustrEE event with BP was well attended. They provided us with an engaging talk about some of the control behind modern plants and pipelines. This week we bring you another IndustrEE talk, as well as some interesting events being run by our sponsors.

By the way, if you haven't yet, I urge you all to [vote](https://vote.union.ic.ac.uk) in the Union Elections. Have your say in the people who will be representing you over the coming year. It takes less than 2 minutes, and can be done nicely on your phone too!

Have a great week!

Thomas & the EEsoc Team
